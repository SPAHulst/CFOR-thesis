# Short summary

In this thesis, we investigate two heuristic approaches for solving the Capacitated Fixed Order Routing (CFOR) problem:  
- **Column Generation (CG)**  
- **Columnwise Neighborhood Search (CNS)**

The CFOR problem is a variation of vehicle routing where destination order within vehicles is fixed and capacity constraints apply.
